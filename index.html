My plan
Hi. I'm Alec Gargett and I have a plan.

My plan aims to:

Solve the cost of living crisis while protecting and improving our quality of life, our environment, the beauty of our city and our suburbs, and our public services.
Solve the algae crisis and stop corporations and our government from contributing to the pollution crises that are causing it.
Solve the health care crisis, including the ramping crisis, and the aged care crisis.
Solve the underemployment crisis. Ensure that every Australian is not only adequately trained, but also supported with job placements that make the best use of their skills, talent and knowledge.
Solve the corruption crisis, the parliamentary inefficiency crisis, and the flaws in our democracy. Deliver integrity in politics, transparency, efficiency and accountability in government and a stronger democracy, where politicians serve and represent their communities and pursue the interests of their electorate, not a separate agenda of a political party or corporations.
Solve the police staffing crisis.
Protect our children, women and men from unfair treatment and harm, including from advertising like gambling adverts. Within the limits of our political system, I'll do what I can to protect everyone from injustice.
Big claims? Yes. But at least I have a plan. At least I'm going to try.

Sometimes it seems like most of our politicians and political parties aren't even trying. They play around the edges; throw a lot of money at problems without solving their causes; or choose policies that mitigate some problems while making other problems worse. Sometimes they choose a hopeless political strategy to boot, and for almost all political parties it's a divisive strategy.

My plan involves a comprehensive set of policy solutions, respect for the whole community, and a pragmatic strategy to support a democratic political movement beyond our own electorate here in Waite, and beyond state politics, to influence politics for the better at the federal and international levels. We need better policies and we need a better way of doing politics, and if I'm elected I'll use the platform of state parliament to do my part in both.

I will be explaining my policies in more detail between now and the election, not only here on the website, but in video form on platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Youtube. By the election in March next year, I'll get my plan across to as many people in Waite as I can, and I could use your support. Following me on social media or video platforms so that you can see my policy videos and perhaps even share them around would be a great help. So would sharing this website with whoever you think might be interested.

Best wishes,
Alec Gargett

My policies
A brief summary
All of the crises I mentioned above, including the cost of living crisis, together cause an even bigger and more fundamental crisis: the quality of life crisis. Reducing the cost of living by reducing our quality of life is not a real solution, since fundamentally the main crisis we are trying to solve when we address cost of living is a quality of life crisis.

1. Quality of Life Commission
Solve the cost of living crisis and the quality of life crisis, by creating a Cost of Living and Quality of Life Commission, which I will refer to here simply as the Quality of Life Commission. The Quality of Life Commission will be given the power to regulate against the causes of the quality of life crisis, within limits set by parliament.

2. Housing price growth limit
Democratically determine an upper limit on housing prices relative to the year before. The Quality of Life Commission will enforce this limit with regulations on residential property investments, explained in Policy 3 below. The Quality of Life Commission will also devise a new housing price index that applies the constant quality principle including property size and location, to ensure that we are not only addressing the nominal cost of housing, but also improving the quality of housing that South Australians can afford.

3. Rein in property investors
Incentivise residential property investors to do the right thing, by charging them if they do the wrong thing. For example, residential property investors will be charged if they evict someone from their home just to sell the property to someone wealthier, or if they otherwise fail to allow the property to be used by the person or family with the greatest moral right to the property. The Quality of Life Commission will be instructed to devise a system for determining and enforcing this, and will determine the rate of these variable charges to ensure meeting the housing price target.

4. Keep people in their homes, and allow non-owner residents to buy
Once the above policies are implemented, allow renters to buy their home, and keep family homes in the family where desired, by allowing HECS-style loans for the buyer.

Wait! Wouldn't that push up housing prices?

No, for two reasons:

Firstly, the HECS-style loan would only be exactly the size necessary to allow the buyer to make up the difference in their buying power to the target market price, and only the prospective buyer with the greatest moral right to purchase would get access to this loan.
Secondly, due to policies 2 and 3, explained above, the Quality of Life Commission would adjust charges on property investors by whatever amount needed to compensate, keeping average prices at or below the target housing price limit. As part of this, a wealthy residential landlord selling to anyone other than the rightful buyer granted the HECS loan would be charged a fee for doing so, incentivising them to sell to the rightful buyer at the target market price.
5. Stop giving our resource wealth away for free
Natural resources under the ground legally belong to the state, which means they belong to all South Australians. Giving away these resources to large corporations for free is one of the biggest rorts in our history. The Quality of Life Commission will charge whatever rate maximises benefits for South Australians, which will fund measures to reduce the cost of living, detailed below.

6. Cut prices on other essentials
Reduce prices on essentials like electricity, aged care and healthy foods for South Australians through regulation and compensation. The Quality of Life Commission will regulate to reduce the price of these essentials for South Australians, and compensate the retailers only the amount needed to ensure adequate supply, rather than handing out unconditional subsidies and rebates that can raise prices. Reducing the cost of electricity will help to reduce pollution, by helping people switch from polluting gas and wood burning to electricity.

7. Provide HECS-style loans for efficiency upgrades
Provide HECS-style loans for purchases that reduce costs and increase efficiency such as switching to electric heating, solar water heating, or repainting a dark roof to a heat-reflecting white. Again, this will be designed to avoid causing increases in prices, and even reduce prices, by providing only enough to make the difference up to the target price.

8. Create a South Australian government employment service
Provide government-supported apprenticeships and job placements for all unemployed and underemployed Australians who want them by creating a South Australian government employment service. Expert in the field, David O'Halloran, PhD, recommends creating government employment services at the state level rather than at the federal level. Currently we have neither. The existing private services are inadequate. With the support of the funding from the Quality of Life Commission's charges, the South Australian government employment service will ensure that everyone has the support they need to do the work that will most benefit South Australians, and that businesses that need support to help with this will be given that support.

9. Maintain refugee intake but reduce net immigration
During Covid, rents became cheaper, and when businesses opened back up again, but borders were still shut, unemployment dropped to the lowest rate in 50 years. And this is only the short term effects. In the long term, the quality of housing we are living in will continue to get worse if the population density in our cities continues to grow at millions per decade, the rate that corporations and their political parties have chosen. It also increasingly makes it hard to solve other problems: harder to build enough public transport and eliminate traffic congestion and transport pollution, harder to reduce harm to our environment and animals through land use, resource use, production, construction and consumption.

Policy 8 above will reduce reliance on skilled immigration and negate the need for bringing so many skilled visa holders into South Australia by training underemployed and undertrained Australians and providing more paid work experience opportunities. We can address almost all of our real skills shortages locally, not only through tertiary education, but also through government-supported and business-supported apprenticeships, other on-the-job training, and other paid work experience opportunities, for people who are already here, rather than bringing additional people in from interstate and overseas to compensate for our lack of proper training systems and job experience opportunities.

10. Increase the number of hospitals, emergency departments and staff. Reopen the Blackwood Hospital and the Repat emergency department
Increase not only the size of emergency departments and hospitals, but also the number of them, the number of staff, and the number, quality and affordability of aged care centres. We can:

Where feasible, reopen hospitals that are no longer being used as hospitals, such as the Blackwood Hospital.
Where feasible, reopen emergency departments that have been closed, like the emergency department at the Repat.
Build new hospitals, and design them to efficiently provide the most desperately needed services.
Increase the number of clinical psychology placements, especially Masters programs, and medical degrees by a large enough number to address shortages in care. Allow psychologists to assist psychiatrists in mental hospitals. Hire more social workers and occupational therapists to assist psychiatrists in our mental hospitals.
Investigate the viability of specialist graduate medical programs at our universities, so that qualified health professionals can become specialist doctors by learning only what is relevant to a chosen specialty.
Policies 1 and 5 above will be implemented so to pay for the above.

11. Build housing the right way
The above policies may be enough to solve the housing affordability crisis, but we also need to improve the quality of housing that people can afford by building the right type of high-quality housing in the right locations, instead of destroying the beauty of our existing suburbs and wasting land on the outskirts with a lack of proper planning. With all of the above policies, we won't need to sacrifice our quality of life to reduce the cost of living anymore. We can replace ugly buildings with beautiful ones, instead of replacing beautiful buildings and gardens with ugly ones, and we can plan new land releases better to use the land more efficiently with higher quality housing with a wide variety of densities, along with adequate space for new hospitals and other necessary amenities and infrastructure.

12. Solve the police staffing crisis
Provide funding to create a new unarmed, ununiformed position called a Police Support Officer to support SAPOL in their work, and hire at least 200 people for this position. Provide funding for the police to improve their hiring processes with better objective testing of applicants and better job performance assessment processes, and for experts at our universities to carry out helpful studies into better procedures. Policies 1 and 5 above will be implemented so to pay for this.

13. Solve the algae crisis, and the pollution crises that are causing it
I am working on a video explaining this policy in more detail, which I plan to release by December 18 at the latest.

14. Reduce traffic congestion and pollution
Reduce traffic congestion and pollution with much higher quality public transport. Increase the frequency of bus services with a new electric or plug-in hybrid bus fleet. Make every second bus free. Introduce more bus lanes to bypass traffic.

15. Improve the Belair train line
Currently trains going in opposite directions share the same track on the Belair line, and have to wait for each other to pass. Reduce this issue by duplicating the track wherever feasible. Once these works are done, electrify the line. Once these upgrades are complete, expand the Belair train line to Mount Barker.

16. Make environmentally friendly choices more affordable
In addition to Policies 6 and 7, the Quality of Life Commission will be charged with finding other ways to reduce pollution by making environmentally friendly choices more affordable.

17. Solve the corruption crisis
Deliver integrity in politics, transparency and accountability in government and a stronger democracy, where politicians serve and represent their communities and pursue the interests of their electorate, not a separate agenda of a political party or corporations. My plan for this will later be published in detail, but the plan starts with supporting the movement for more independent politicians in this country. In the meantime, there are some reforms that ideally should be implemented immediately, even prior to the coming election in March 2026.

Tighten the cap on candidate spending. Although political donations have been banned, wealthy candidates can still spend up to $100 000 on their campaign under current laws, while other candidates may not be able to afford even spending $10 000. This creates an unfair disadvantage for less wealthy candidates, and even some wealthier candidates might prefer to spend less on the condition that none of their opponents is spending more than they are. The statewide cap should probably be lowered to around $10 000 per candidate, and the spending cap in individual electorates certainly shouldn't be higher than the majority (median) of the candidates in that electorate would prefer.
Ban political campaigning at polling booths. It's annoying, and it creates further bias towards candidates with more resources.
Hold council elections on the same day as state elections in order to increase council voting and thereby increase accountability of local councils. Allow candidates to run for multiple positions (but not multiple wards/electorates), such as mayor and MP, but only accept one of the positions if they win more than one. Due to our preferential voting system, votes can easily be redistributed if a candidate wins more than one position and has to turn one down.
18. Prevent harm from advertising
Give both SA Health and the EPA the power to regulate against harmful advertising, such as gambling ads or alcohol ads, especially when children may be present, and to regulate product packaging to better inform consumers about products.

19. Free sport and healthy activity classes
Provide sporting clubs and similar clubs with the funding to provide South Australians with at least one free group lesson per year. Policies 1 and 5 above will be implemented so to pay for this.

20. Address the environmental causes of mental illness and violence
Fund science, science integrity and science communication when it comes to the environmental causes of mental illness and violence, and develop science-based policy to address the causes of mental illness and violence. The science on the causes of mental illness and violence is inadequate, and the good science that has been done has not been adequately communicated to the public, who are exposed to simplistic and incorrect narratives about the causes of mental illness and violence, some of which increase conflict and hatred and lead to more violence.

Paying for good policy
Some of the solutions to our problems such as the cost of living crisis are expensive, but they are affordable with the right policies for generating government revenue.

This problem is actually quite easy to solve. The Quality of Life Commission will charge corporations and decamillionaires (people with $10 million or more in net worth) for

Use of state-run services and state-owned resources
Any other action that harms or costs South Australians
The biggest missed opportunity for government revenue is the donation of our natural resources to corporations instead of selling them. Natural resources below the ground legally belong to the state, which means they belong to South Australians, but our government gives those natural resources away for free to corporations, instead of selling them. Not only is this a massive missed opportunity for government revenue, it's one of the biggest rorts in our country's history.

The above has been widely discussed, but my plan goes further, charging large corporations, and harmful businesses like casinos, for anything that costs or harms South Australians.

More details on the underemployment crisis
The official (low hours) underemployment rate is 5.9%, and the real underemployment rate may be well over 20%. 5.9% is only the employed Australians who are working fewer hours than they would like to. It doesn't include the 4.5% of unemployed Australians who are seeking a job, which makes a total of more than 10% of Australians who would like more hours of work than they have. Even this combined figure doesn't include all of the 20% of Australians who are not fully using their qualifications, not to mention the unknown number of Australians whose skills and knowledge are not being put to best use, meaning that the true underemployment rate, in the broader sense, may be well over 20%. Unlike the piecemeal plans of our political parties, my plan outlined above will fully resolve this issue if well-implemented, especially policies 8 and 9.

In 2024, over 30% of Computing and Information Systems university graduates reported that they did not have full-time employment 4 to 6 months after graduating, and of those with full-time employment, an additional 28% reported that they were not fully utilising their skills and education, meaning only about 50% were working full-time in an area that fully utilised their skills. Even within Engineering, 15% of graduates did not have full-time employment and an additional 23% reported they were not fully utilising their skills and education. For all degrees combined, 26% of graduates were not in full-time employment and an additional 28% of full-time employed graduates reported that they were not fully utilising their skills and knowledge. Many graduates are rejected from relevant jobs because employers prefer to bring people in from overseas with a more impressive CV. The federal Labor government plans to bring 1 million more people in on visas over the next 4 years, leading to an increase in the population of 1.4 million, about the size of the entire city of Adelaide. This has benefits, especially for property developers, immigration lawyers, and large corporations that work to keep their profits high by keeping salaries low and their training costs low, but Australians have been gaslighted by politicians and some of their followers on the downsides of this for everyone else, which only adds to the misguided hatred such as racism that they claim to oppose. We are told by politicians that several million more people per decade is necessary to address skills shortages and has negligible downsides, but there are over two million underemployed or unemployed Australians that can be trained to solve almost all of our real skills shortages, and who desperately need that extra income, many of whom already have the necessary education.

For a deeper discussion of the related underpayment crisis, and my creative writing, see my old artist website.

More details on the immigration policies of the major parties
The Albanese government's current plan is net immigration of 230 000 per year, a rate of 2.3 million people per decade. The opposition's plan is to reduce this to a net intake of 130 000 per year, a rate of 1.3 million per decade. Neither has a comprehensive plan like my plan above to end our reliance on high rates of skilled worker immigration.

The harder problem of global injustice and violence.
Although I am confident that we can solve most of our crises listed above locally, there are global problems that are much harder to solve, like the problems of global pollution, war and unjust violence. I'll do what I can to come up with a solution, and support others working on a solution. I am confident that we can show leadership to the rest of the world through our actions to address our own problems here in South Australia, and that this will put us in a position to have a better influence on world affairs.

Beyond policy
By itself, even the most comprehensive set of policies is not a complete solution without a viable strategy. To get good policies implemented, we need to build a political movement that will be taken seriously by the government, and become a part of government. We also need to address what is fundamentally broken in our major parties. If a major party cannot be fixed, it needs to be replaced by independents, and if necessary by new political parties, that are designed to hold politicians accountable to their electorates, rather than pushing some other agenda of the party or its donors.

If I am elected, I won't be resigned to what I can do within state parliament to influence state policy as a single MP. I will use the platform of state parliament to support the movement toward a better democracy, which will influence both the state and federal government to do better.

Explaining my policies and my strategy in more detail
My policies will be explained in more detail here and on other platforms like Facebook, Youtube and Instagram between now and the election in March next year.
